  abstract  = {Myofibrillogenesis in situ was investigated by confocal microscopy of immunofluorescently labelled whole mount preparations of early embryonic chicken heart rudiments. The time-course of incorporation of several components into myofibrils was compared in triple-stained specimens, taken around the time when beating starts. All sarcomeric proteins investigated so far were already expressed before the first contractions and myofibril assembly happened within a few hours. No typical stress fibre-like structures or premyofibrils, structures observed in cultured cardiomyocytes, could be detected during myofibrillogenesis in the heart. Sarcomeric proteins like (α)-actinin, titin and actin were found in a defined localisation pattern even in cardiomyocytes that did not yet contain myofibrils, making up dense body-like structures. As soon as the heart started to beat, all myofibrillar proteins were already located at their exact position in the sarcomere. The maturation of the sarcomeres was characterised by a short delay in the establishment of the pattern for M-line epitopes of titin with respect to Z-disk epitopes and the incorporation of the M-line component myomesin, which preceded that of myosin binding protein-C. Thus dense body-like structures, made up of titin, (α)-actinin and actin filaments serve as the first organised complexes also during myofibrillogenesis in situ and titin functions as a ruler for sarcomere assembly as soon as its C termini have become localised. We suggest that assembly of thin and thick filament occurs independently during myofibrillogenesis in situ and that myomesin might be important for integrating thick filaments with the M-line end of titin.},

  abstract = {Many cell types respond to forces as acutely as they do to chemical stimuli, but the mechanisms by which cells sense mechanical stimuli and how these factors alter cellular structure and function in vivo are far less explored than those triggered by chemical ligands. Forces arise both from effects outside the cell and from mechanochemical reactions within the cell that generate stresses on the surface to which the cells adhere. Several recent reviews have summarized how externally applied forces may trigger a cellular response (Silver FH and Siperko LM. Crit Rev Biomed Eng 31: 255–331, 2003; Estes BT, Gimble JM, and Guilak F. Curr Top Dev Biol 60: 91–126, 2004; Janmey PA and Weitz DA. Trends Biochem Sci 29: 364–370, 2004). The purpose of this review is to examine the information available in the current literature describing the relationship between a cell and the rigidity of the matrix on which it resides. We will review recent studies and techniques that focus on substrate compliance as a major variable in cell culture studies. We will discuss the specificity of cell response to stiffness and discuss how this may be important in particular tissue systems. We will attempt to link the mechanoresponse to real pathological states and speculate on the possible biological significance of mechanosensing.},

Detachment of adult cardiomyocytes from the matrix enables the study of matrix effects on cell shortening, Ca2+ handling and myofilament function. Cell shortening and Ca2+ handling are altered in cardiomyocytes cultured for 24 h on a stiff matrix. Matrix stiffness-impaired cardiomyocyte contractility is reversed upon normalization of extracellular stiffness. Matrix stiffness-induced reduction in unloaded shortening is more pronounced in cardiomyocytes isolated from obese ZSF1 rats with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction compared to lean ZSF1 rats. Abstract Extracellular matrix (ECM) stiffening is a key element of cardiac disease. Increased rigidity of the ECM passively inhibits cardiac contraction, but if and how matrix stiffening also actively alters cardiomyocyte contractility is incompletely understood. In vitro models designed to study cardiomyocyte–matrix interaction lack the possibility to separate passive inhibition by a stiff matrix from active matrix-induced alterations of cardiomyocyte properties. Here we introduce a novel experimental model that allows exploration of cardiomyocyte functional alterations in response to matrix stiffening. Adult rat cardiomyocytes were cultured for 24 h on matrices of tuneable stiffness representing the healthy and the diseased heart and detached from their matrix before functional measurements. We demonstrate that matrix stiffening, independent of passive inhibition, reduces cell shortening and Ca2+ handling but does not alter myofilament-generated force. Additionally, detachment of adult cultured cardiomyocytes allowed the transfer of cells from one matrix to another. This revealed that stiffness-induced cardiomyocyte changes are reversed when matrix stiffness is normalized. These matrix stiffness-induced changes in cardiomyocyte function could not be explained by adaptation in the microtubules. Additionally, cardiomyocytes isolated from stiff hearts of the obese ZSF1 rat model of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction show more pronounced reduction in unloaded shortening in response to matrix stiffening. Taken together, we introduce a method that allows evaluation of the influence of ECM properties on cardiomyocyte function separate from the passive inhibitory component of a stiff matrix. As such, it adds an important and physiologically relevant tool to investigate the functional consequences of cardiomyocyte–matrix interactions.},

  abstract = {High-resolution three-dimensional (3-D) microscopy combined with multiplexing of fluorescent labels allows high-content analysis of large numbers of cell nuclei. The full automation of 3-D screening platforms necessitates image processing algorithms that can accurately and robustly delineate nuclei in images with little to no human intervention. Imaging-based high-content screening was originally developed as a powerful tool for drug discovery. However, cell confluency, complexity of nuclear staining as well as poor contrast between nuclei and background result in slow and unreliable 3-D image processing and therefore negatively affect the performance of studying a drug response. Here, we propose a new method, 3D-RSD, to delineate nuclei by means of 3-D radial symmetries and test it on high-resolution image data of human cancer cells treated by drugs. The nuclei detection performance was evaluated by means of manually generated ground truth from 2351 nuclei (27 confocal stacks). When compared to three other nuclei segmentation methods, 3D-RSD possessed a better true positive rate of 83.3% and F-score of 0.895±0.045 (p-value=0.047). Altogether, 3D-RSD is a method with a very good overall segmentation performance. Furthermore, implementation of radial symmetries offers good processing speed, and makes 3D-RSD less sensitive to staining patterns. In particular, the 3D-RSD method performs well in cell lines, which are often used in imaging-based HCS platforms and are afflicted by nuclear crowding and overlaps that hinder feature extraction.},

  abstract = {Changes in myocyte cell shape and tissue structure are concurrent with changes in electromechanical function in both the developing and diseased heart. While the anisotropic architecture of cardiac tissue is known to influence the propagation of the action potential, the influence of tissue architecture and its potential role in regulating excitation-contraction coupling (ECC) are less well defined. We hypothesized that changes in the shape and the orientation of cardiac myocytes induced by spatial arrangement of the extracellular matrix (ECM) affects ECC. To test this hypothesis, we isolated and cultured neonatal rat ventricular cardiac myocytes on various micropatterns of fibronectin where they self-organized into tissues with varying degrees of anisotropy. We then measured the morphological features of these engineered myocardial tissues across several hierarchical dimensions by measuring cellular aspect ratio, myocyte area, nuclear density and the degree of cytoskeletal F-actin alignment. We found that when compared with isotropic tissues, anisotropic tissues have increased cellular aspect ratios, increased nuclear densities, decreased myocyte cell areas and smaller variances in actin alignment. To understand how tissue architecture influences cardiac function, we studied the role of anisotropy on intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) dynamics by characterizing the [Ca2+]i-frequency relationship of electrically paced tissues. When compared with isotropic tissues, anisotropic tissues displayed significant differences in [Ca2+]i transients, decreased diastolic baseline [Ca2+]i levels and greater [Ca2+]i influx per cardiac cycle. These results suggest that ECM cues influence tissue structure at cellular and subcellular levels and regulate ECC.},

  abstract  = {Fourier descriptors are an interesting method for modeling 2D shapes that are described as closed contours. Unlike polylines or splines, which are explicit and local descriptions of the contour, Fourier descriptors are global shape representations, that is, each component stands for a particular characteristic of the entire shape. If one component is changed, the whole shape will change. The advantage is that it is possible to capture coarse shape properties with only a few numeric values, and the level of detail can be increased (or decreased) by adding (or removing) descriptor elements. In the following, we describe what is called ``cartesian'' (or ``elliptical'') Fourier descriptors, how they can be used to model the shape of closed 2D contours and how they can be adapted to compare shapes in a translation-, scale-, and rotation-invariant fashion.},
